**Abstract:** *Cree* is a toolbox to design and run economic experiments. *Cree* places very few restrictions on the devices facing subjects, thus *Cree* experiments can be run in a myriad of settings. This opens up a new path for researchers, however the path is not without obstacles. This paper describes how many of these obstacles are alleviated though the technical design of *Cree*. The main remaining obstacle is the selection process, especially if subjects can self-select into experiments.
